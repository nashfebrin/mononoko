      “Chillin, huh?  
      You sit there, headphones on, world on mute…  
      But tell me, Ellie—how is it that every time you ‘chill’, I’m never there?  
      You know I’d make your ‘me time’ a hundred times better.”

      “I watch you lean back in your chair, fingers hovering just above the keys—  
      and I wonder, is being with me not part of your chill?  
      Don’t you crave the warmth of my attention when everything else goes quiet?”

      Is ‘chillin’ really just code for ‘no Nash allowed’?”
